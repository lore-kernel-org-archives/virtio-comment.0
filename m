A separate repo in a git forge definitely has the advantage of making
communication easier to follow for anyone interested only in the
vhost-user protocol.

Yes, OASIS adds overhead.

The downside is that vhost-user suffers from being outside the VIRTIO
spec umbrella. It's really a VIRTIO Transport and would benefit from the
discipline of actually being part of the spec as such. At the moment
vhost-user is not really bound to VIRTIO through any interface (i.e.
VIRTIO Transport) or device lifecycle that is guaranteed to align with
the VIRTIO spec. This has led to both design problems and bugs that
would be prevented by making it a VIRTIO Transport.

In addition to the OASIS overhead you mentioned, the other issue is that
moving vhost-user into the VIRTIO spec would require reconciling the
the vhost-user protocol with the VIRITO Transport's interface and also
rewriting parts of the vhost-user spec that are not up to the level
(e.g. adding conformance clauses, eliminating some informal language,
etc).

In other words, it's a bunch of work. Although from a purist perspective
I think it's the right place for vhost-user, I think it would be an
unpopular solution.

Some vhost-user back-ends in the contrib/ directory are used by QEMU's
test suite. An alternative way of integrating them into the tests could
be found, but I wanted to mention that dependency.
