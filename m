The simplest way is to say each struct virtio_blk_discard_write_zeroes
(currently 16 bytes long) is padded to 512 bytes, but this wastes a lot
of memory.

Stefano and I looked at the status of multiple segment discard/write
zeroes in Linux: only the NVMe driver supports multiple segments.  Even
SCSI sd doesn't support multiple segments.

Userspace APIs do not offer a way for applications to submit multiple
segments in a single call.  Only the block I/O scheduler creates
requests with multiple segments.

SPDK's virtio-blk driver and vhost-user-blk device backend also only
support 1 segment per request.

Given this situation, I'm not sure it's worth the complexity to spec out
a fancy padding scheme that no one will implement.  Wasting 512 - 16
bytes per segment also seems unattractive.  IMO it's acceptable to
introduce a feature bit if struct virtio_blk_discard_write_zeroes needs
extension in the future.

The Linux guest driver doesn't honor 512 byte padding, so device
backends would already need to make an exception if we spec 512 byte
padding.

Let's begin VIRTIO 1.1 with the state of real-world implementations:
data[] must be a multiple of sizeof(struct
virtio_blk_discard_write_zeroes).

I'll send a patch to the virtio TC and we can discuss further in that
thread.
